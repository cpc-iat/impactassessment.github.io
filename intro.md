## Introduction

This book provides the tools, the methods, and the theory to meet
the challenges of contemporary data science applied to geographic
problems and data. Social media, new forms of data,
and new computational techniques are revolutionizing social science.
In the new world of pervasive, large, frequent, and rapid data, we have
new opportunities to understand and analyze the role of geography in
everyday life. The book provides the first comprehensive curriculum in
geographic data science.

Geographic data is ubiquitous. On the whole, social processes, physical
contexts, and individual behaviors show striking regularity in their patterns,
structures, and spacing. As data relating to these systems grows in scope,
intensity, and depth, it becomes more important to extract meainingful
insights from location, relation, and position.

This book serves as an introduction to a new way of thinking about geographic
challenges. Using geographical analysis and computational reasoning, it shows
the reader how to unlock new insights hidden within data. The book is
structured around the excellent data science environment in Python,
providing examples and worked analyses for the reader to replicate,
adapt, extend, and improve.

## Pedagogical approach

Geographic Data Science is a new field, but has many academic influences
and precursors. Currently, curriculum development
is forced to combine snippets of unpublished research code and vignettes
together with various packages in the Python data science ecosystem.

The present book considers students as learners of both analytical *and*
computational methods. We provide accessible, open computational examples
with high-quality narrative exposition. This combination is design to satisfy
the two main requirements from students:

- As learners of *analytical* methods, students want the narrative
scaffolding, careful explanation, and intelligible writing provided by typical introductory textbooks. 
- As learners of *computational* approaches, students need worked examples
of code alongside an explanation on how to get started even doing analysis.

There are many hurdles over which students jump just to start the first
example of many introductory textbooks. Our book provides a full view of
Geographic Data Science, from setting up and organizing computational
environments to preparing data, through to developing novel spatial insight
and presenting it cogently to others. This kind of integrated approach is
necessary for data science, but is missing in current market offerings.
