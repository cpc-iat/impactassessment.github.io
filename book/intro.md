## Executive Summary

In recent years, technological innovations such as ride-sharing apps have profoundly altered the way cities function and citizens interact with city systems. Urban innovations will continue to have an impact on the economy, the environment, and the lives of citizens, but challenges remain in the areas of assessing the positive or negative impacts of innovations involving unproven technologies or approaches. This lack of clarity gives rise to two problems in particular:
• Innovative ideas fail to secure the financial support needed to start up or scale up due to an absence of track record; and
• City leaders and decision-makers are unable to make informed decisions about which ideas to approve due to a lack of understanding of the impacts on urban systems, citizens and the economy.
While there are existing impact assessment guidelines published by the UK government (e.g. the Green Book issued by HM Treasury) and by multilateral agencies, applying these guidelines to urban innovation projects presents a number of challenges, including:
• Certain methodologies within the guidelines (e.g. input-output models for economic impact analysis) lack relevance to small-scale pilot urban innovation schemes because they are often written for large-scale infrastructure projects or large-scale policy changes;
• They tend to focus on estimating potential impacts of proposed projects. Guidance on evaluation of actual project outcomes is not normally the focus, meaning that important opportunities to test and refine the impact assessment models are missed; and
• They often focus on one or two of the three principal impact dimensions – economic, environmental, or social – but rarely cover all three in equal depth.

With the goal of bridging these gaps, Future Cities Catapult – in partnership with leading UK and US universities – has developed the Performance in Use (PIU) toolkit as a practical guide for conducting impact assessment for urban innovation projects. Our aim is to help practitioners: (1) prospectively appraise potential impacts of planned interventions; and (2) retrospectively evaluate the actual impact and effectiveness of deployed solutions. Relevant guidebooks are referenced for further discussion.

By applying the PIU toolkit practitioners can:
• Increase project effectiveness and credibility by conducting an impact mapping exercise (see Chapter 2);
• Conduct a systematic and rigorous impact assessment analysis irrespective of industry and technology (see Chapter 3);
• Benefit from guidance on how economic, environmental and social impacts are measured (see Chapters 4, 5, 6);

• Learn how to integrate economic, environmental and social impacts to aid decision-making or to communicate overall impacts more effectively (see Chapter 7); and
• Develop an effective strategy for capturing and articulating anticipated benefits and for de-risking the project by conducting sensitivity analysis (see Chapter 8).
We recognise that developing an impact assessment methodology for a fast-changing sector such as the urban innovation space means our toolbox will need periodic updates. This document represents the start of an open-ended process. As the toolkit is applied to different categories of
project across multiple contexts, fresh insights and ‘lessons learned’ will be captured in our evidence base and used to refine future iterations of this PIU toolkit.

## Pedagogical approach

Geographic Data Science is a new field, but has many academic influences
and precursors. Currently, curriculum development
is forced to combine snippets of unpublished research code and vignettes
together with various packages in the Python data science ecosystem.

The present book considers students as learners of both analytical *and*
computational methods. We provide accessible, open computational examples
with high-quality narrative exposition. This combination is design to satisfy
the two main requirements from students:

- As learners of *analytical* methods, students want the narrative
scaffolding, careful explanation, and intelligible writing provided by typical introductory textbooks. 
- As learners of *computational* approaches, students need worked examples
of code alongside an explanation on how to get started even doing analysis.

There are many hurdles over which students jump just to start the first
example of many introductory textbooks. Our book provides a full view of
Geographic Data Science, from setting up and organizing computational
environments to preparing data, through to developing novel spatial insight
and presenting it cogently to others. This kind of integrated approach is
necessary for data science, but is missing in current market offerings.
